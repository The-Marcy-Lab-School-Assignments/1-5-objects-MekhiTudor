# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
The best time to use an array over a method is when the order of your data matters. On the other hand, you would want  to use objects when readability and qualitative information takes precedent.

# Teacher Feedback

Yup and not a method, you mean an object!
