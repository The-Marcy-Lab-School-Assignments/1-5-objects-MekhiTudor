# Question

What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer

When you pass by value, you are making copies of the original values to be manipulated, this isn't mutable. However, when you pass things by reference, you are directly effecting the original value.

~~Pass by value is what strings have, their values get passed in rather than their reference so they do not get affected by changes performed by a function.~~

Yup just one small add-on, primitive data types get passed by values ad non-primitives are passed by reference! Pass by reference is mutable since we are targeting specifically the location in memory.
