# Question

Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer

The reason this isn't proper JSON is because there is not any double quotes around the keys.

# Teacher Feedback

We as developers can also write json! The reason why this one is not proper json is because we need the double quotes around the keys.
